# ecommerce-backend

This project is was created for a challenge to build the back end for an e-commerce site.
Express.js API is used along with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database to allow for creation, updating and deletion of data in my database.

I had an issue initializing the database due to local connection errors which I believe was caused due to an issue with the downloaded packages. If required I will recreate this repository and start from a clean slate to ensure the right packages are used and see if that solves the issues.
